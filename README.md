# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder & Brute Force Cracker

This is a simple Python project that implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithm. It also includes a **brute-force tool** to decode messages without knowing the original shift key.

## 📚 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Example

Original: hello <br>
Shift 3 : khoor

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Encode a message using a shift key
- 🔓 Decode a message with a known key
- 🕵️ Brute-force decode a message by trying all possible shifts
